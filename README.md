# place.git

Basically r/place, but with git. Fork this repo, add your python turtle code and make a PR. We'll see where we end up!

## Points to note

- Add as many lines as you want. Anywhere you want. Don't edit or remove existing lines.
- The program needs to be running once you're done with your changes. And no infinite loops.
- You're not allowed to add more than 5 seconds of execution time. Give others a shot too.
- Don't import any libraries other than the already imported ones.
- Use any turtle method you'd like. (except `done()`)
- Have fun!

## Raising Issues
If you have any other suggestions or would like to remove a line or import a library, raise an issue on this repository and we'll be promptly responding.
